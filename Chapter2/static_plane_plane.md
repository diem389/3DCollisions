# Plane Plane intersection

We've already done some work with plane intersection, when we did the intersection for 3 planes onto a point. Luckly the intersection of 2 planes is a lot simpler.

The only time two planes don't intersect is if they are parallel. If the planes are not parallel they will intersect in a line (of infinate length)

## The Algorithm

```cs
code
```

## On Your Own

Add the following function to the ```Collisions``` class:

```cs
code
```

And provide an implementation for it!

### Unit Test

You can [Download](../Samples/StaticIntersections.rar) the samples for this chapter to see if your result looks like the unit test.
