# Intersections

Now that we've defined the basic primitives we are going to work with, let's get started on some intersection tests. An intersection test is essentially asking, is this spehere intersecting that AABB in any way?

For intersection testing, we're going to focus on solids. Line and Ray tests (Ray casting and Line casting) are going to get their own section.

It's also important to understand that the tests for static objects and dynamic objects are not necesarley the same. More on this in sections to come.
