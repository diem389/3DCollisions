# AABB v AABB intersection

One to the most useful intersection tests is testing an AABB against another AABB. In fact, this is probably the intersection test you will use the most!

## The Algorithm

```cs
code
```

## On Your Own

Add the following function to the ```Collisions``` class:

```cs
code
```

And provide an implementation for it!

### Unit Test
