#Point in Triangle

The easyest way to test if a point is in a triangle is commonly refered to as the [Same Side](http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/pointinpoly/) technique. I suggest reading that article, only the Same Side portion, not the barycentric one. The only problem is, the method presented is a 2D method. In addition to the 3 side tests you must also check if the test point is on the plane formed by the triangle.

Given the above paragraph and the extra condition i gave you you could build a 3D point in triangle test, but it would be an expensive one. Instead, we can do the test much cheaper.

### A cheaper test

There is another intersection test we can perform, this one is easyer to read but harder to visualize. In order to properly demonstrate it, i will provide two visual examples. One if a triangle / point pair that inersects and one that doesnt.
