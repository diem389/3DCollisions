# Triangle Triangle

As mentioned above, the triangle-triangle test is a generic form SAT test. As such

## The Algorithm

Add the following private static function to your collision class, it's going to be a helper function to get the interval of the triangle. You can return the interval however you like (Make a new class, use a vector 2, use out variables), whatever makes sense to you. I did mine with a Vector2.

```cs
Vector2 GetInterval(Triangle triangle, Vector3 axis) {
    // Vector2.X = min
    // Vector2.Y = max.
}
```

## On Your Own

Add the following function to the ```Collisions``` class:

```cs
code
```

And provide an implementation for it!

### Unit Test

You can [Download](../Samples/SAMPLE.rar) the samples for this chapter to see if your result looks like the unit test.
