The Model-Plane collision is similar to Model-Sphere. 

You have to multiply the normal by the inverse world (MultiplyVector, not point), and you have to scale D the same way we scaled R in model-sphere

Feel free to work ahead and do this one without the pages, if you do, write your own unit for it.
