# Line Testing

Line testing is just a specialized form of ray casting. This test is done the same way all the other line tests are done, i'm not going to provide too much information on it.

## On Your Own

Implement the following function

```cs
public static bool LineTest(Line line, Triangle triangle, out Point result) {
```

It's just like all theother line test functions, i'm not going to go over it in detail.
