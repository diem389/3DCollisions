# Closest Point on Plane

Sometimes knowing if a point is on a plane or not isn't enough. Imagine your character walking in a room. You want the feet of your character to be on the floor. This is where knowing the closest point on plane helps. You can get your characters position, and the closest point on the ground plane is where you need to place him.
