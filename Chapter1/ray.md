#Ray 

A ray is similar to a line (not line segment). A ray is a single point in space with a direction. It extends infinatley far away in that single direction (as opposed to a line, which extends in both directions).

With the above definition, the code for a ray is pretty simple:

```cs
class Ray {
    public Point position;
    public Vector3 direction;
}
```

Much like line segments, rays are fairly straight forward objets.
