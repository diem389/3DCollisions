# Closes Point On Sphere

Finding the closest point on a sphere can be just as useful as knowing if a point is inside a sphere or not. The closest point on sphere is often used for AI, Physics simuation and special effects.

The key to the closest point on sphere algorithm is to realize that no matter where that point may be, it will always be the same distance from the center of the sphere. That distance is equal to the radius.

Before reading the next paragraph (Because i will answer the question there), see if you can figure out given a point and a sphere how to get the closest point on the sphere to that point. I'll provide an image:
