#Physics Engines
Collisions in games are usually handled by physics engines. Mobile games sometimes forgo the physics engine in favor of more efficient hand-coded collisions, but with how powerful mobile devices are getting this is becomming less and less of a concern. Let's explore a few engines

### [Farseer](https://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/)

Farseer is one of the few engines specifically targetted at C#. As such, it was actually written in C#! This is their official description: Farseer Physics Engine is a collision detection system with realistic physics responses. This means you can create a game or robotic simulation easily using the engine and the associated tools. Everything from a simple hobby game to a complex robotic simulation is possible with Farseer Physics Engine

### [JigLib](http://jiglibx.codeplex.com/)
The other engine written specifically for C#! It's a port of a non C# engine, but it performs quet well

### [PhysX](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/physx)
Unity, and most AAA games that ship use this as their physics engine. Written and maintained by NVidia, this engine has amazig performance as it can run mainly on the GPU.
