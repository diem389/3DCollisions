# Ray Against Sphere

Given the following image, we have :
* Ray __R__, defined by:
  * point __p0__
  * normal __d__
* Sphere __S__, defined by:
  * center point __c__ 
  * radius __r__

## The Algorithm

```cs
code
```

## On Your Own

Add the following function to the ```Collisions``` class:

```cs
code
```

And provide an implementation for it!

### Unit Test
