##New Repo Time!

Now that we're done with OpenGL it's time to start a new repo on github. Let's call this one "CollisionDetection". Make the repo, clone it, add the appropriate .gitignore, commit the changes. Make a new Visual Studio solution, inside the cloned repo. The solution only needs to have 1 project in it.

Once you have a solution and project set up, put the math libary we wrote into it. Collisions are going to be math heavy. Also set up OpenTK. Even tough we will not focus on rendering, we will want to visualize this stuff.
