# Camera

So far, we've set the view matrix of every example scene manually. Now, it's time to implement a camera! We're going to implement a mouse controlled editor camera. Our controls are going to be:

* Left click + Drag - Move the camera around
* Right click + Drag - Rotate the camera around
* Mouse wheel - Zoom the camera in and out 

## The Algorithm

```cs
code
```

## On Your Own

Add the following function to the ```Collisions``` class:

```cs
code
```

And provide an implementation for it!

### Unit Test
